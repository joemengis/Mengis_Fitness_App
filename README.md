# Objective: Create the backend code for this Workout Tracker
Objective is to complete a first version of this app by adding the server side code.  Need to add code for the models, routes and mongoos and express installations.  When done, the app will run with no errors.

## User Story
* As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
